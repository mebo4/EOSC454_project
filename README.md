# EOSC454_project

Using magnetic data inversion, this project analyzes faults and tectonic structures in British Columbia. Studying faults and tectonic structures using magnetic data enhances geophysical exploration techniques. It is crucial to assess geological stability, predict seismic activity, and guide infrastructure planning in seismically active regions. Fault zones often exhibit magnetic anomalies due to rock composition, deformation, and fluid activity variations. By applying geophysical inversion techniques, this study will map subsurface magnetic variations to identify and characterize major fault structures, providing insights into their geological significance and potential environmental impact.
