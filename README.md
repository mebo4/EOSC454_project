# EOSC454_project

This project aims to analyze faults and tectonic structures in British Columbia using magnetic data inversion. Studying faults and tectonic structures using magnetic data not only enhances geophysical exploration techniques but also plays a crucial role in assessing geological stability, predicting seismic activity, and guiding infrastructure planning in seismic active regions. Fault zones often exhibit magnetic anomalies due to variations in rock composition, deformation, and fluid activity. By applying geophysical inversion techniques, this study will map subsurface magnetic variations to identify and characterize major fault structures, providing insights into their geological significance and potential environmental impact.
